#----------------------------------------------Veriable and data type ----------------------------------------
# #String can be "ABC" or 'ABC' or """ABC"""
#Next line use \n
# Str1 = "This is a string.\nWe are creating it in python"
# print(Str1)


#Concatenation
# str1 = "Anjali"
# str2 = "Tiwari"
# print(str1 + str2)


#Length of string
# str1 = 'Anjali'
# str2 = "Tiwari"
# len1 = len(str1)

#Questions - Variables & Assignments (Tasks 1â€“10)

#1. Assign your name to a variable and print it.
#2. Store your age in a variable and print it.
# Name = "Doree"
# Age = 5
# print(Name)
# print(Age)


#3. Swap values of two variables without using a third variable.
# A = 50
# B = 70
# A = A*B #3500
# B = A/B #3500/70 = 50
# A = A/B #3500/50 = 70
# print("After swapig the first value would be:", A, "and the second value would be:", B)


#4. Assign float and integer values to variables and print their types.
# V1 = 20.25
# V2 = 56
# print(type(V1))
# print(type(V2))


#5. Create a variable storing a sentence and print only the first word. - Split mathed 
# Var1 = "This is Angela and i am citizen of the USA"
# print(len(Var1))
# x = Var1.split(" ")[0] 
# print(x)


#6. Use multiple assignments in one line (a, b, c = 1, 2, 3).
# a = 1
# b = 2
# c = 3
# print("(a , b, c =", a,",", b,",", c, ")")


#7 Create a variable that stores the result of a mathematical expression. - need to ask


#8. Store a number and print its square using **. - need to ask
# N = 7
# print(**N)


#9. Assign a number and convert it to a string, then print it.
# Num = 9
# A =str(Num)
# print(type(A))
# print(A)


#10. Store a boolean value and print its type.
# A = True
# B = False
# print(type(A))
